## Compiling and Running the calculator
### The easy way (Windows)
Download the `.swift` file from this repository, and install [Swift for Windows](https://swiftforwindows.github.io/).
You can then compile and run your downloaded `.swift` file.
### The more complex way
Install the official swift compiler: [swift.org](https://www.swift.org/).
Set-Up a coding enviroment (you can use [this](https://www.swift.org/getting-started/#installing-swift) tutorial)
Next you can open the .swift file in your editor of choice and compile the code.
